# vader-sentiment-example

## Installation

- To use this, I first installed [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
- I then navigated to the environments window of the Anaconda Navigator and opened a Python terminal from my base environment
- I then installed pip from that terminal via `conda install pip`

## Use

- I then used pip to install vaderSentiment via `pip install vaderSentiment`
- I then used the attached iPython Notebook (`vader-sentiment-example.ipynb`) to use python/vaderSentiment, using a function adapted from [this vaderSentiment-based tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/almost-real-time-twitter-sentiment-analysis-with-tweep-vader-f88ed5b93b1c)
